# App Description
In this exercise, a simulation of a classic kid’s toy, the **Magic Eight Ball** is built.

This application consists of two components:

*App*:
    A simple component that just renders an EightBall component.

*EightBall*:
    The component for the magic eight ball. The EightBall takes a single property, answers, which is an array of objects, with each object having a key for msg and color. The EightBall has a state to keep track of the current color and message text, and this state initially is “black” and “Think of a Question”. The ball chooses a random message when it is clicked on. This changes the background color of the ball and the message.
